# outlineBrowser2

JavaScript code to display JSON outlines.

### Status of the project

I forked this from the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/outlineBrowser">previous outlineBrowser</a> written years ago. 

I want to be able to fix stuff without worrying about backward compatibility.

Older code uses the first version of the outlineBrowser code, preserved in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/outlineBrowser">this repo</a>.

### Updates
